# Data Modelling
## Overview of Data Modelling
Aims of data modelling:
- Describe what **information** is contained in database.
- Describe **relationships** between data items.
- Describe **constraints** on data.

Data modelling is a **design** process that converts requirements into a data model.

Kinds of data models:
- **Logical**: abstract, for conceptual design.
    - Examples: ER, ODL, UML.
- **Physical**: record-based for implementation.
    - Examples: relational, SQL.

## Quality of Designs
Most important aspects of a design:
- **Correctness**: satisfies requirements accurately.
- **Completeness**: all requirements covered and assumptions made explicit.
- **Consistency**: no contradictory statements.

Potential **inadequacies** in a design include:
- **Omits information** that needs to be included.
- Contains **redundant information** (which can lead to inconsistency).
- Leads to an **inefficient implementation**.
- **Violates syntactic or semantic rules** of data model.
